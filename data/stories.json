He was known throughout the land for his cunning tricks and his insatiable appetite.\n\n## The Invitation\n\nOne day, the birds received an invitation to a magnificent feast in the sky kingdom. They were excited and began preparing for the journey. Ijapa, overhearing their plans, desperately wanted to join them, but he had no wings.\n\n## Ijapa's Cunning Plan\n\nUsing his silver tongue, Ijapa convinced the birds that he would be an excellent addition to their delegation. \"I am wise and can speak eloquently on your behalf,\" he told them. Each bird, moved by his words, donated a feather to him, and soon Ijapa had a beautiful pair of wings.\n\n## The Feast\n\nWhen they arrived in the sky, the hosts announced, \"This feast is for 'All of You.'\" Ijapa quickly said, \"My name is 'All of You,'\" and proceeded to eat the entire feast before anyone else could touch the food.\n\n## The Punishment\n\nThe angry birds took back their feathers one by one, leaving Ijapa stranded in the sky. With no way down, he called to his wife below to bring soft things for him to land on. But his wife, tired of his tricks, only brought hard stones.\n\n## The Fall\n\nIjapa fell from the sky, landing on the stones with a tremendous crash. His shell broke into many pieces. Although a medicine man glued his shell back together, Ijapa's shell has been cracked ever since—a permanent reminder of the price of greed and deception.\n\n## The Lesson\n\nThis tale teaches us that:\n- Greed leads to isolation\n- Deception catches up with the deceiver\n- Trust, once broken, is hard to repair\n- True wisdom lies in honesty and integrity\n\nThe cracks on the tortoise's shell serve as an eternal reminder of Ijapa's foolishness, teaching generations of children the importance of good character over clever tricks.",
