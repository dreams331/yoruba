# Latest Updates - October 24, 2025

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Article Detail Page "Not Found" Error
**Problem**: Articles were showing "Article Not Found" when clicking through from the articles page.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `js/article-detail.js` to properly merge CMS content with fallback data
- Improved article lookup to search both by numeric ID and slug
- Added better error handling and logging

**Result**: All articles now load correctly on the detail page.

### 2. ✅ CMS Not Reflecting Existing Content
**Problem**: The CMS only had 1-2 sample articles, but the site showed 12+ articles. Content wasn't editable in the CMS.

**Solution**:
- Created `populate-cms.js` script to convert all fallback content to Markdown files
- Generated 12 article files in `content/articles/`
- Generated 3 story files in `content/stories/`
- Added npm script: `npm run populate` for easy execution
